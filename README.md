#Introduction to spatial analysis in R (rasters)

###Jamie Afflerbach

R is getting better and better at spatial data visualization and analyses. This tutorial specifically focuses on working with raster, or gridded, data in R.

The tutorial is laid out as an exploratory analyses similar to those I've done myself. The objective of this tutorial is to use different types of raster data to answer the scientific question:

####What areas within the California Current are suitable for seamonkey aquaculture?

Along the way you'll learn how you can use R to **read**, **reproject**, **crop**, **mask**, run **calculations and zonal statistics**, **plot**, **save** and more with raster data.

The code is stored in the `intro_spatial_data_R.Rmd` file. The code has been rendered using [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) to create both a [PDF](https://github.com/jafflerbach/spatial-analysis-R/blob/master/intro_spatial_data_R.pdf) and an [.html](https://cdn.rawgit.com/jafflerbach/spatial-analysis-R/master/intro_spatial_data_R.html) to use as references rather than running the code again in the future.
