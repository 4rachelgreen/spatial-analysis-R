This tutorial specifically focuses on working with raster, or gridded, data in R.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is laid out as an exploratory analyses similar to those I've done myself. The objective of this tutorial is to use different types of raster data to answer the scientific question:\r\n\r\n####What areas within the California Current are suitable for seamonkey aquaculture?\r\n\r\n![](./images/seamonkeys.png)\r\n\r\nAlong the way you'll learn how you can use R to **read**, **reproject**, **crop**, **mask**, run **calculations and zonal statistics**, **plot**, **save** and more with raster data.\r\n\r\nThe code is stored in the `intro_spatial_data_R.Rmd` file. The code has been rendered using [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) to create both a [PDF](https://github.com/jafflerbach/spatial-analysis-R/blob/master/intro_spatial_data_R.pdf) and an [.html](https://cdn.rawgit.com/jafflerbach/spatial-analysis-R/master/intro_spatial_data_R.html) to use as references rather than running the code again in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
